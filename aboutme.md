## About Me

Hello, my name is AmusingImpala, sometimes with a 75, sometimes not.

(Coding) Languages I know:
- Java (Major application being modding Minecraft. Fabric > Forge, though I don't yet know how I feel about Quilt)
- Python (kinda)
- C++ (also kinda, but a bit less kinda and a bit more actually)
- C (surprisingly know this more than C++)
- Javascript (but why would I really need this?)
- Theoretical knowledge of Assembly (Give me a list of the instructions and registers, and I can probably make it work)

(Spoken) Languages I know:
- English
- Classical Latin
- Koine/Attic Greek

Recommended Reading:
- The Bible (Seriously, it can change your life)
- Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkein. Once you have read these four (really just two), you should move on to the other Middle Earth works, such as The Silmarillion or the Lost Tales.
- Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky

I use a M1 MacBook Air, 2011 iMac with Debian, and a iPhone 6 with AltStore and jailbroken with Chimera. I avoid proper IDEs, instead opting for something like neovim. You should try it out.  
I play cello and piano, and enjoy philosophical discussions and reading the great books and classics. I also knit, and can crochet. I am a totally depraved Calvinist who believes that God has predestined salvation for me (and others of course).  
(Unpopular opinion) If a given piece of music was written after 1950, it's probably bad. Exceptions include Aaron Copland. Bach, Mozart, and Beethovan reign supreme in terms of music quality.
